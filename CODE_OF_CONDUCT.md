# Code of Conduct

## Our Commitment

The Digital Field Geoscience Wiki is a community-driven resource committed to providing a welcoming, safe, and productive environment for all contributors, regardless of background, identity, experience level, or any other personal characteristic.

This Code of Conduct applies to all project spaces, including the GitHub repository, discussions, issues, pull requests, and any project-related communications.

## Expected Behaviour

We expect all contributors to:

- **Be respectful and professional** – Use welcoming language, be considerate of differing viewpoints, and critique ideas rather than people
- **Be collaborative** – Listen to others, accept constructive feedback gracefully, and focus on what is best for the community
- **Give credit** – Acknowledge the work and contributions of others appropriately
- **Take responsibility** – Own your actions and contributions
- **Act with integrity** – Maintain high standards of honesty and scientific rigour

## Unacceptable Behaviour

We will not tolerate:

- Harassment, discrimination, or exclusionary behaviour based on any personal characteristic
- Sexist, racist, or derogatory comments or jokes
- Personal attacks, trolling, insults, or bullying
- Unwelcome sexual attention or inappropriate comments about appearance
- Publishing others' private information without permission
- Sustained disruption of discussions or contributions
- Any other conduct that could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Scientific Integrity

As a geoscience resource, we expect contributors to:

- Provide **accurate** information that reflects current best practices
- **Cite sources** properly and never plagiarise
- Contribute within areas of **documented expertise and experience**
- Present information **objectively** and acknowledge uncertainties
- Be **transparent** about methods, data sources, and potential conflicts of interest

## Enforcement

### Reporting

If you experience or witness unacceptable behaviour, please report it to:

- **Brian Burnham** – brian@vrgeoscience.com
- **David Hodgetts** – david@vrgeoscience.com

All reports will be handled confidentially and investigated promptly.

### Consequences

Project maintainers will respond to violations appropriately, which may include:

- A private warning or discussion
- Temporary or permanent removal from the project
- Deletion of inappropriate contributions

Decisions will be made fairly based on the severity and context of the violation.

### Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing these standards. They have the right to remove, edit, or reject contributions not aligned with this Code of Conduct, and to ban contributors for inappropriate behaviour.
