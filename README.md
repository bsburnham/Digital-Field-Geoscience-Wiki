**A community-driven wiki capturing best practices for digital field geoscience data collection**

---

## 🌍 About This Wiki

Modern field-based geoscience is increasingly complimented by digital data from smartphone apps to uav-based photogrammetry. This wiki serves as an **open, collaborative resource** that captures current best practices, standards, and methods for digital fieldwork across the geoscience community.

**The Goal:** To provide freely accessible, community-maintained guidance on digital field data collection methods. 

### Why This Wiki?

Digital field geoscience practices are commonplace and rapidly evolving, yet knowledge about methods, workflows, and data standards remains scattered across pay-walled publications, repositories, and institutions. This wiki brings together community expertise in one accessible platform to document best practices, share workflows, and establish standards that benefit the entire geoscience community.

- 📚 **Comprehensive Coverage** - Equipment, methods, standards, and workflows
- 🤝 **Community-Driven** - Built by and for the geoscience community
- 🔄 **Living Document** - Continuously updated as technology evolves
- 🆓 **Openly Accessible** - Free to use, modify, and share (CC BY-SA 4.0)
- 🎓 **Educational Focus** - Suitable for students, educators, and professionals
